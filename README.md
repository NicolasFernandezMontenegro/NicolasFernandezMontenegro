### Computer Science Student @ FAMAF-UNC | Backend & Cloud Engineer

I am a 5th-year Computer Science student and a certified Computer Analyst focused on cloud-native backend systems and scalable architectures.

I design and build REST APIs and AI-powered data processing pipelines using Python and Google Cloud (Cloud Run, Firestore, GCS, Document AI), with emphasis on scalability, security, and system reliability.

My strong background in systems programming and high-performance computing gives me a deep understanding of concurrency, performance, and infrastructure behavior.
